# Revert Wikipedia Layout

This extension will allow you to use the old Wikipedia layout without the need to create an account.

Many individuals prefer the old Wikipedia layout (pre-2023)â€” this extension aims to bring that back.

Wikipedia offers registered users to change their layout preferences through their account settings, however, incognito and unregistered users are unfortunately left out. This simple extension solves this issue by adding the necessary URL parameter to every Wikipedia page, to ensure that the old layout is displayed.
